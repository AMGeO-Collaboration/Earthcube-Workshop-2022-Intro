This might be a Jupyter Notebook.\n\n- Configuration files for your environment. This ensures that your code is reproducible.\n\n---\n\nYou will be working simultaneously with the Binder notebook and these slides.\n\nYou can find the  <a href=\"https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/throughput-ec/ec-binder/HEAD\" target=\"_blank\">Binder</a>.\n\nClick on the previous link, the Binder will be launched.

This is great for workshops, tutorials, and classes.\n- Binder can provide interactivity to documentation and demonstrations of tools. \n- Binder can provide interactivity to readers, allowing them a more rich experience with your content.\n\n---\n\n# Limitations of Binder\n- Each instance is limited to 2 gb of RAM and will get destroyed after 10 minutes of inactivity. \n- Each instance can run for a maximum of 24 hours before it will get killed.\n- You can get around these limitations by hosting your own binder hub but this will require compute + devops resources from your side.\n\n---\n\n#

Dealing with Data\n\nData Science is the study, development and practice of reproducible and auditable processes to obtain insight from data. $^1$\n\nFrom this definition, we must also define

The authors provided several versions of their dataset. Post-publication peer review confirmed that none of these versions fully recapitulates the results presented in the cohort background comparisons, casting doubt on the reliability of the data. Additional concerns were raised about the randomisation procedure, as the equal distribution of male and female patients is unlikely unless sex is a parameter considered during randomisation. However, based on the clarification provided by the authors, sex was not considered during this process. The Editors therefore no longer have confidence in the results and conclusions presented.\"\n\n---\n\n## When Research Goes Wrong\n\nThe problem doesn't just stop once the article is retracted. Between the time the article was published and retracted, the article was cited 17 times!\n\nThe use of non-reproducible tools can impact government and industry as well! \n\n---\n\n## Workflows Importance\n\n- It makes it easier to collaborate with your most imporant collaborator - YOU in 6 months!\n- It makes others think you know what you are doing.\n\n---\n\n## Workflows & complex projects\n\nComplex projects have at least one item of the following list:\n\n- two, or more, people directly working on the analysis\n- projects that involve two or more coding documents\n- projects that involve analysis of medium/large data\n- projects where you are working on a remote machine\n- projects that have many software or environment dependencies\n\nAs a project accumulates more of these features it grows further in complexity.\n\n---\n\nComplex projects without intentional Data Science workflows can result in:\n\n- An result that you cannot recreate.\n- Spare files of information related to the project that only you have access to.\n- A small change to the analysis code requires re-running the entire program taking several hours.\n- Code that can only be run on one machine (The \"But it runs on my computer\" problem)\n\n---\n\n## Avoiding the Chaos\nUse:\n- Version Control (Git & GitHub)\n- Write Executable analysis scripts & pipelines (Python/R scripts)\n- Defined & shippable dependencies as we saw (Docker)\n\n\n---\n\n## Version Control\n\n- Use GitHub Issues for communications related to the project\n- Version control contributes to better communication & team work\n- All collaborators/team members know where to find the latest (or earlier) version of the analysis (code and output)\n\nAll collaborators/team members have access to all communications associated with the analysis\n\n---\n\n## Executable analysis scripts & pipelines\n\nAs analysis grows in length and complexity, one literate code document generally is not enough\n\nTo improve code report readability (and code reproducibility and modularity) it is better to abstract at least parts of the code away (e.g, to scripts)\n\nThese scripts save figures and tables that will be imported into the final report\n\nExample problem solved by executable analysis scripts & pipelines\nProblem: A small change to the analysis code requires re-running the entire thing, and takes hours.\n\nSolution: Use a smart dependency tree tool to only re-run the parts that needs to be updated.\n\n---\n\n## Defined & shippable dependencies\n\nDependencies are other things one need to install to run your code, and includes:\n- programming languages (e.g., R, Python, Julia, etc)\n- packages from programming languates (e.g., tidyverse, scikit-learn)\n- Dependencies include versions too\n\nExample problem solved by defined & shippable dependencies\nProblem: Code that can only be run on one machine, and you don't know why.\n\n---\n\n## Life cycle of a data analysis project\n\nIt is also critical that you match the correct data science methods to the type of statistical question you are asking.\n\n---\n\n## Descriptive\n\nOne that seeks to summarize a characteristic of a set of data. No interpretation of the result itself as the result is a fact, an attribute of the data set you are working with.\n\nExamples:\n\nHow many people live in each US state?\n\n---\n\n## Exploratory\n\nOne in which you analyze the data to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables looking for patterns that would support proposing a hypothesis to test in a future study.\n\nExamples:\n\nDoes air pollution correlate with life expectancy in a set of data collected from groups of individuals from several regions in the United States?\n\n---\n\n## Inferential\n\nOne in which you analyze the data to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables in a representative sample. We want to quantify how much the patterns, trends, or relationships between variables is applicable to all individuals units in the population.\n\nExamples:\n\nIs eating at least 5 servings a day of fresh fruit and vegetables is associated with fewer viral illnesses per year?\n\n---\n\n## Predictive\n\nOne where you are trying to predict measurements or labels for individuals (people or things). Less interested in what causes the predicted outcome, just what predicts it.\n\nExamples:\n\nHow many viral illnesses will someone have next year?\n\n---\n\n## Causal\n\nAsks about whether changing one factor will change another factor, on average, in a population. Sometimes the underlying design of the data collection, by default, allows for the question that you ask to be causal (e.g., randomized experiment or trial)\n\nExamples:\n\nDoes smoking lead to cancer?\n\n---\n\n## Mechanistic\n\nOne that tries to explain the underlying mechanism of the observed patterns, trends, or relationship (how does it happen?)\n\nExamples:\n\nHow does how airplane wing design changes air flow over a wing, leading to decreased drag?\n\n---\n\n## What happens next?\n\nKnowing the kind of question you are trying to answer, helps narrow down the possibilities of the kind of analysis you might want to do.\n\nFor example, if you have the question: \"How many viral illnesses will someone have next year?\" and you identify that it is predictive. You could narrow down that some kind of statistical or machine learning model might help you answer that.\n\nThen you need to go a step deeper and look at the data that you have, and see which kind of statistical or machine learning model is most suitable for your data.\n\n---\n\n# Let's Practice What We Learned","fields":{"slug":"/chapter7_03_ds_workflows"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n<div><h1><img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module1/00_ec_slide1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"EC Theme\" width=25% align=\"left\"/> Lesson 4<br>Testing</h1></div>\n\n---\n\n## What is Testing?\n\n- Method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements\n- Ensures that software product is Defect free. \n- It involves execution of software components using manual or automated tools to evaluate properties of interest. \n- The purpose is to identify errors or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements.\n\n---\n\n## Types of Testing\n\n- Unit testing  \n    - Tests whether an individual component of a piece of software works as expected.\n\n- Integration testing  \n    - Tests whether separate components of a piece of software, which depend upon eachother, work together as expected.\n\n- Regression testing\n    - Tests that recent changes do not break older features.\n\n---\n\n## Unit Testing\n\nHow can we be so sure that the code we wrote is doing what we want it to?\n\nDoes our code work 100% of the time?\n\n- The answer is: units tests.\n\n- In Python unit tests can be implemented using assert statements although there are other ways.\n\n- Let’s first discuss the syntax of an assert statement and then how they can be applied to the bigger concept, which is unit tests.\n\n---\n\n## Assert Statements\n\n``` python\nassert 1 == 2 , \"1 is not equal to 2.\"\n```\n\n``` out\nAssertionError: 1 is not equal to 2.\n\nDetailed traceback: \n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n```\n\n---\n\n`assert` statements can be used as sanity checks for our program.\n\nWe implement them as a “debugging” tactic to make sure our code runs as\nwe expect it to.\n\nWhen Python reaches an `assert` statement, it evaluates the condition to\na Boolean value.\n\nIf the statement is `True`, Python will continue to run. However, if the\nBoolean is `False`, the code stops running, and an error message is\nprinted.\n\n\n---\n\n## Example 1\n\nLet’s take a look at an example where the Boolean is `True`.\n\n``` python\nassert 1 == 1 , \"1 is not equal to 1.\"\nprint('Will this line execute?')\n```\n\nWhat do you think the output will be?\n\n---\n\nAnswer: \n\n```out\nWill this line execute?\n```\n\nHere, since the `assert` statement results in a `True` values, Python\ncontinues to run, and the next line of code is executed.\n\n---\n\n## Example 2\n\n``` python\nassert 1 == 2 , \"1 is not equal to 2.\"\nprint('Will this line execute?')\n```\n\nWhat do you think the output will be?\n\n---\n\nAnswer: \n\n``` out\nAssertionError: 1 is not equal to 2.\n\nDetailed traceback: \n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n```\n\n\nWhen an assert is thrown due to a Boolean evaluating to `False`, the\nnext line of code does not get an opportunity to be executed.\n\n---\n\n## When to test?\n\n\n- You probably are used to creating a function, and only after that,  you might want to write the tests.\n\n- Actually, writing tests should be done *before* the actual function. This is called Test-Driven Development.\n\n- This may seem a little counter-intuitive, but we’re creating the  expectations of our function before the actual function code.\n\n- Often we have an idea of what our function should be able to do and what output is expected.\n\n- Writing tests before the function, help understand what code is needed and it avoids encountering large bugs down the line.\n\n- It is recommended to write multiple tests.\n\n---\n\n## What to test?\n\n- Keep these tests simple - things that we know are true or\ncould be easily calculated by hand.\n\nFor example, let’s look at our `exponent_a_list()` function.\n\nEasy cases for this function would be lists containing numbers that we\ncan easily square or cube.\n\nFor example, we expect the square output of `[1, 2, 4, 7]` to be\n`[1, 4, 16, 49]`.\n\n---\n\n``` python\ndef exponent_a_list(numerical_list, exponent=2):\n    new_exponent_list = list()\n    \n    for number in numerical_list:\n        new_exponent_list.append(number ** exponent)\n    \n    return new_exponent_list\n```\n\n``` python\nassert exponent_a_list([1, 2, 4, 7], 2) == [1, 4, 16, 49], \"incorrect output for exponent = 2\"\n```\n\n``` python\nassert exponent_a_list([1, 2, 3], 3) == [1, 8, 27], \"incorrect output for exponent = 3\"\n```\n\n``` python\nassert type(exponent_a_list([1,2,4], 2)) == list, \"output type not a list\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Systematic Approach\n\nWe use a **systematic approach** to design our function using a general\nset of steps to follow when writing programs.\n\n***1. Write the function stub: a function that does nothing but accepts\nall input parameters and returns the correct datatype.***\n\n``` python\ndef exponent_a_list(numerical_list, exponent=2):\n    return list()\n```\n\n---\n\n***2. Write tests to satisfy the design specifications.***\n\n``` python\ndef exponent_a_list(numerical_list, exponent=2):\n    return list()\n   \nassert type(exponent_a_list([1,2,4], 2)) == list, \"output type not a list\"\nassert exponent_a_list([1, 2, 4, 7], 2) == [1, 4, 16, 49], \"incorrect output for exponent = 2\"\nassert exponent_a_list([1, 2, 3], 3) == [1, 8, 27], \"incorrect output for exponent = 3\"\n```\n\n``` out\nAssertionError: incorrect output for exponent = 2\n\nDetailed traceback: \n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n```\n\n---\n\n***3. Outline the program with pseudo-code.***\n\n``` python\ndef exponent_a_list(numerical_list, exponent=2):\n\n    # create a new empty list\n    # loop through all the elements in numerical_list\n    # for each element calculate element ** exponent\n    # append it to the new list \n    \n    return list()\n    \nassert type(exponent_a_list([1,2,4], 2)) == list, \"output type not a list\"\nassert exponent_a_list([1, 2, 4, 7], 2) == [1, 4, 16, 49], \"incorrect output for exponent = 2\"\nassert exponent_a_list([1, 2, 3], 3) == [1, 8, 27], \"incorrect output for exponent = 3\"\n```\n\n``` out\nAssertionError: incorrect output for exponent = 2\n\nDetailed traceback: \n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n```\n\n---\n\n***4. Write code and test frequently.***\n\n``` python\ndef exponent_a_list(numerical_list, exponent=2):\n    new_exponent_list = list()\n    \n    for number in numerical_list:\n        new_exponent_list.append(number ** exponent)\n    \n    return new_exponent_list\n    \nassert type(exponent_a_list([1,2,4], 2)) == list, \"output type not a list\"\nassert exponent_a_list([1, 2, 4, 7], 2) == [1, 4, 16, 49], \"incorrect output for exponent = 2\"\nassert exponent_a_list([1, 2, 3], 3) == [1, 8, 27], \"incorrect output for exponent = 3\"\n```\n\n---\n\n***5. Write documentation.***\n\n``` python\ndef exponent_a_list(numerical_list, exponent=2):\n    \"\"\" Creates a new list containing specified exponential values of the input list. \n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    numerical_list : list\n        The list from which to calculate exponential values from\n    exponent : int or float, optional\n        The exponent value (the default is 2, which implies the square).\n    \n    Returns\n    -------\n    new_exponent_list : list\n        A new list containing the exponential value specified of each of\n        the elements from the input list \n        \n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> exponent_a_list([1, 2, 3, 4])\n    [1, 4, 9, 16]\n    \"\"\"\n    new_exponent_list = list()\n    for number in numerical_list:\n        new_exponent_list.append(number ** exponent)\n    return new_exponent_list\n```\n\n--- \n\n## Organizing tests\n\nTests are organised hierarchically: expectations are grouped into tests which are organised in files:\n\nAn expectation is the atom of testing:\n- It describes the expected result of a computation. Examples:\n    - Does it have the right value and right class? \n    - Does it produce error messages when it should? \n    \nA test groups together multiple expectations to test the output from a simple function.\nThis is why they are sometimes called unit as they test one unit of functionality. \n\n---\n\n## Tools for Testing\n\nThere are automated tools we can take advantage of: \n- `pytest` and `asssert` for Python\n- `testthat` for R\n\n---\n\n# Let's practice what we learned!\n","fields":{"slug":"/chapter7_04_testing"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n<div><h1><img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module1/00_ec_slide1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"EC Theme\" width=25% align=\"left\"/> Lesson 8<br>Software Licensing</h1></div>\n\n---\n\n## Copyright Law\n\nIn both the US and Canada, software code falls under copyright law.\n\nThe owner of the copyright can decide how this code may be used, copied, distributed, changed, among other activities.\n\nWarning!\nCopyright protects the language and words used to express ideas, concepts and themes.\nIt does not protect not the ideas, concepts or themes themselves.\n\n---\n\n## Copyright Owner Rights\n\nIn the USA, the owner of copyright has the exclusive right to do and to authorize others to do the following:\n\n- To reproduce the work in copies or phonorecords;\n- To prepare derivative works based upon the work;\n- To distribute copies or phonorecords of the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;\n- To publicly perform the work, in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works;\n- To publicly display the work, in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work.\n- To digitally transmit sound recordings by means of digital audio transmission.\n\n[Copyright Law of the USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_States#Exclusive_rights)\n\n---\n\n## Who has copyright ownership? \n\n- You if you are author the code and you are doing this for yourself (i.e., not for your work)\n\n- In such a case, you (the person who typed the code) automatically become the copyright owner.\n\n    - In the USA, you do not need to use the copyright symbol © .\n\n    - Best practices: Use the copyright symbol along with your name and the year of first publication.\n\n    - Register tools that you publicate at USA Copyright Registration Portal\n\n---\n\n- The employer or client if you were doing a job for them.\n\n- Implications if you would like to reuse a code that you did for your employer in a different situation:\n    - Negotiate a licence to use the code you wrote.\n\n---\n\n## Why do I need a license?\n\nAs mentioned above, creative works (like software code) are automatically eligible for intellectual property (and thus copyright) protection\n\nReusing creative works without a license is dangerous, because the copyright holders could sue you for copyright infringement\n\nThus, if you publicly share your creative work (i.e., software code), you should let others know if and how they can reuse it\n\nThis is done via the inclusion of a LICENSE or LICENSE.txt file in the base directory of the repository that clearly states under which license the content is being made available\n\nUnless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation.\n\n---\n\n## How do licenses work?\n\nA license grants rights to others (the licensees) that they would otherwise not have.

For example, you can run a workflow to automatically add the appropriate labels whenever someone creates a new issue in your repository.\n\n- GitHub provides Linux, Windows, and macOS virtual machines to run your workflows, or you can host your own self-hosted runners in your own data center or cloud infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## Key concepts:\n\n- Actions: Individual tasks you want to perform.\n\n- Workflow: A collection of actions (specified together in one file).\n\n- Event: Something that triggers the running of a workflow.\n\n- Runner: A machine that can run the Github Action(s).\n\n- Job: A set of steps executed on the same runner.\n\n- Step: A set of commands or actions which a job executes.\n\n---\n\n## Create an example workflow\n\n1.
